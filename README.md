# Checkered-past!

This python program provides a two-player classic Checkers game. The user is able to pick between different modes of plays in ranging difficulty. Undoubtedly, we have the normal mode for a classic Checkers game. On the easier side, the game has the "Instructional Mode" which gives players visual cues regarding their possible moves. We also have different time modes for players looking for a challenge! Additionally, in this game you can pick different color boards and different tunes to be played while the game is happening!
